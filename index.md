## Yuqi Jing
y5jing [at] uwaterloo [dot] ca


I am a MMath student in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at University of Waterloo, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chengguo Weng](https://www.chengguoweng.com/). Currently, I'm looking for a research topic in Finance. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Manchester, in the Mathematics Department, advised by Prof. [Korbinian Strimmer](https://strimmerlab.github.io/korbinian.html).

My research is at the intersection of maths, finance and machine learning.
