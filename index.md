## Yuqi Jing

Email: y5jing [at] uwaterloo [dot] ca

I am a MMath student in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at University of Waterloo, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chengguo Weng](https://www.chengguoweng.com/). Currently, I'm working on a regression problem in Portfolio Theory. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Manchester, in the Mathematics Department, advised by Prof. [Korbinian Strimmer](https://strimmerlab.github.io/korbinian.html).

My research interest is at machine learning, portfolio theory, optimization and simulation. 

    
&nbsp;  
### My current focus
I'm currently spending my 3rd term as a master student in UWaterloo. I plan to stay in UWaterloo for the 4th term as MMATH.
